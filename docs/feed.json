The story of Gunpowder Proof Rum began in the days of ‘wooden ships and iron men,’ when Royal Navy sailors were issued a daily ‘tot’ of rum on board ship, rationed out by the ship’s ‘Purser’ (known as ‘Pusser’ to the sailors). To shut down claims of watered-down rum, the Pusser would douse a few grains of gunpowder in the rum and attempt to light it. If the mix ignited, the rum was ‘at proof.’ If not, the pusser might find himself tossed to sea. This beloved tradition continued for over 300 years until the Admiralty ended the daily rum ration on 31 July 1970–now known as Black Tot Day.After distillation, the rum is aged for a minimum of three years in charred oak bourbon barrels—imparting additional smoothness and flavor. The tropical climate in Guyana helps the rum reach its maturity faster than spirits aged in higher latitudes. Pusser’s Rum is all natural – no artificial flavouring or colouring is added.About Pusser’s RumPusser’s Rum rums are blended to create the ideal balance of naturally occurring flavouring compounds known as “esters” and “congeners.” The molasses used in each of the contributing stills comes from sugar cane grown in the Demerara River Valley—once the home of 300 sugar cane estates each with its own distillery.
