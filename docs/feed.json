The story of Gunpowder Proof Rum began in the days of ‘wooden ships and iron men,’ when Royal Navy sailors were issued a daily ‘tot’ of rum on board ship, rationed out by the ship’s ‘Purser’ (known as ‘Pusser’ to the sailors). To shut down claims of watered-down rum, the Pusser would douse a few grains of gunpowder in the rum and attempt to light it. If the mix ignited, the rum was ‘at proof.’ If not, the pusser might find himself tossed to sea. This beloved tradition continued for over 300 years until the Admiralty ended the daily rum ration on 31 July 1970–now known as Black Tot Day.After distillation, the rum is aged for a minimum of three years in charred oak bourbon barrels—imparting additional smoothness and flavor.

            "content_text": "Mount Gay XO Reserve is a blend of rums aged 8-15 years distilled in a traditional column still and double retort pot still. The sugar cane used in this rum is fully sourced in Barbados and the Caribbean. A proprietary strain of heirloom yeast is used in closed fermentation for the column-distilled rum. For the pot-distilled rum, open-air fermentation is initially used. This process exposes the molasses and water to the Bajan atmosphere, allowing breezes to carry native yeasts into the mix. The rums were aged in three different cask types: ex-American Whiskey, Bourbon, and Cognac.About Mount GayA legal deed dated from February 20, 1703 confirms the existence of a “pot still house” on Mount Gay’s sugar cane Estate in Barbados, which establishes Mount Gay as the world’s oldest rum producer.
