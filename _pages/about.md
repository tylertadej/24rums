**24 Rums** is a little website that documents the thoughts and research of a quarantined couple exploring the 24 Days of Rum advent calendar as a way to plan future vacations.

During the great quarantine of 2020, I purchased the [24 Days of Rum](https://24daysofrum.com/) advent calendar as an activity to pass time while sheltering in place. My original idea was to celebrate Christmas in July with the advent calendar, but then I had a better idea. Instead of *just* sipping through twenty four different rums, my partner and I could use the different rums as a way to plan future vacations. Each rum was from a different country around the world - the Caribbean, Central and South America, Asia, and elsewhere. Let the vacation planning (and rum sipping) begin!

Cheers,
