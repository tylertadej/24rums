Pixan 8 Años is aged in two different profiles of ex-bourbon American oak barrels for 8 years and then mixed to create a unique combination of flavors. It is handmade in small batches of 300 liters with sugar cane from San Luis Potosi. Monterrey is where Pixan is mixed and aged in small facilities not far from the city.
