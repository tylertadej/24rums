Ron Millonario 10 Anniversario Reserva is a rum from Peru. There isn't any production information on their official website. But there is this description:
> Warm amber in colour, it has an easy and never aggressive nose. Candied oranges, bergamot tea, vanilla and a hint of cola nut are its main aromas. At the palate, it’s lighter and fresher than the older expressions: mainly it tastes of chestnut and acacia honey, candied oranges and citrons and sultana raisins. Slightly hidden, but still evident, are nuts, chocolate, desiccated plums and apricots. Only at the end a peppery sting from the alcohol becomes just noticeable.

### About Ron Millonario

In 1904, in northern Peru, the Hacienda Agrícola de Chiclayo was founded in Chiclayo, a small settlement between the sea and the mountains known as the ‘city of friendship.’ 1950 was an unforgettable year: Ron Millonario was born officially.The rum was the result of hard work, but since few could afford to sample it, it acquired the name “por los millonarios”, in acknowledgement of that exclusive club of individuals wealthy enough to buy the spirit and enjoy its unique charm.
