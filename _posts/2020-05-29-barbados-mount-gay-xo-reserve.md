Mount Gay XO Reserve is a blend of rums aged 8-15 years distilled in a traditional column still and double retort pot still. The sugar cane used in this rum is fully sourced in Barbados and the Caribbean. A proprietary strain of heirloom yeast is used in closed fermentation for the column-distilled rum. For the pot-distilled rum, open-air fermentation is initially used. This process exposes the molasses and water to the Bajan atmosphere, allowing breezes to carry native yeasts into the mix. The rums were aged in three different cask types: ex-American Whiskey, Bourbon, and Cognac.

### About Mount Gay

A legal deed dated from February 20, 1703 confirms the existence of a “pot still house” on Mount Gay’s sugar cane Estate in Barbados, which establishes Mount Gay as the world’s oldest rum producer. The name Mount Gay honours the pioneering Sir John Gay who perfected the distinctive Mount Gay style.
