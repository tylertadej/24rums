Chamarel VSOP is aged 4-6 years. After distillation, the rum is stocked for at least 6 months in stainless steel vats for a slow and gradual decrease of the alcohol content. Part of the White Rum will be transfered to ageing cellars. Barrels, casks, ovals, French oak, American oak, 18 months, 3 years, 6 years... an array of combinations and mystery allow the White Rum to obtain its aromas, its roundness and its color.

### About La Rhumerie de Chamarel

La Rhumerie de Chamarel cultivates its own sugarcane. The plants are carefully selected and grown exclusively for the production of the Chamarel Rums. The harvest is done by hand, without ever burning the crops, and occurs between July to December. The freshly harvested sugarcane is transferred within 4 hours to the distillery to preserve its freshness and aromas. The first pressed sugarcane juice will be filtered, then taken to 25HL stainless steel vats to initiate the alcoholic fermentation.
