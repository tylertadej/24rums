Batavia Arrack is produced in on the island of Java in Indonesia using 100% Sugarcane molasses. A small amount of local red rice is used to start fermentation. It is distilled in traditional pot stills, adopting ancient Chinese distillers’ methods. Next it is blended and stored in Amsterdam where it is aged in oak barrels up to 8 years.

The word "arrack" is likely of Arabic origin; it means “condensation” and is a reference to the process of distillation. In the Middle and Near East, arak or araq, is produced from grapes and flavored with anise and similar to Greek ouzo, Turkish raki or French pastis. Historically, Dutch trading companies used the term "Batavia Arrack" for this Indonesian Rum.
